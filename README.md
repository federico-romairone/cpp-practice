# cpp-practice
This repository contains exercises made during my cpp learning roadtrip

## Exercises

This repository includes the following C++ exercises:

1. **Hello World** - Basic "Hello, World!" program
2. **Variables** - Demonstration of different data types (int, float, double, string, bool, etc.)
3. **Control Flow** - Examples of if-else, loops (for, while), and switch statements
4. **Functions** - Function definitions, parameters, return values, and default parameters

## Building the Exercises

To build all exercises, you need a C++ compiler (g++) and make installed on your system.

```bash
make all
```

This will compile all exercises and place the executables in the `build/` directory.

## Running the Exercises

You can run all exercises at once:

```bash
make run-all
```

Or run individual exercises:

```bash
./build/hello_world
./build/variables
./build/control_flow
./build/functions
```

## Cleaning Up

To remove all compiled binaries:

```bash
make clean
```

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- C++11 or later
- make utility
